          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_language">
            style sheet language</a> used to change the styling/
          presentation of a markup language such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</a>. By using CSS, you can
          change the layout, colours, fonts, sizes and many other features of a website. CSS was initially created on the 17th of December, 1996 by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>. When you create a CSS file, it is saved
          as a .css file, similar to how HTML is saved as a .html file.

          This guide expects that you already know/have the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            You should be relatively familiar with the basics of HTML. You can learn the required HTML knowledge
            <a href="https://codepen.io/nd003/full/JjOpBGm">here.</a>
          </li>
          <li>Basic experience with computers.</li>
          <li>Basic networking knowledge (if you plan on publishing your website).</li>

        <h2>Basic CSS format</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Similar to HTML, CSS is written in a certain format. When CSS is applied to an HTML document, it goes inside a &lt;style> tag.
          Below is an example of the format that CSS is written in.
        <pre>
                            <code>
&lt;style>
    The HTML element that you are styling will go here. {
    The CSS styling element will go here: The value of that styling element will go here;
    You can add more elements as well: You can add as many as you want;
    }
&lt;/style>
                            </code>
                        </pre>
        A semicolon is always required at the end of a CSS value, otherwise the browser won't process it.

      <article>
        <p>
          You will now learn the essential CSS elements and how you can incorporate them into your HTML documents.
          Below is a list that contains the essential elements. All of the elements listed below will use the format shown above.
        <pre>
                            <code>
&lt;style>
    Here are all of the basic and essential CSS elements that you'll need to know {
        font-size: changes the size of the font;
        font-family: changes the font;
        color: changes the colour of the font;
        background-color: changes the colour of the background;
        background-image: sets the image of a background.
        text-align: changes the position of the text (left/right/centre/justify);
        border: creates a box around an element, but to sound very smart and professional it's called a border;
        padding: creates space around an element and its content inside a defined border;
        margin: the same thing as padding, but it creates space outside of a defined border;
        position: changes the positioning method of an element (static/relative/fixed/absolute/sticky);
        !important: prioritises this styling element over anything else. An example is included below;
        font-size: 18px !important;
    }
&lt;/style>
                            </code>
                        </pre>
        Congratulations! You now know the basic CSS elements.

          In the example below, the styling elements of all h1 tags are being changed.
        <pre>
                            <code>
&lt;style>
    h1 {
        font-size: 40px;

        color: white;
        background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
        /* ^ That means that the background colour will be black because black contains 0 red, 0 green and 0 blue. */
        padding: 5px;
        margin: 10px;
        position: relative;
    }

        In the example below, the styling elements of the "main-doc-section" class are being changed.
        <pre>
                            <code>
&lt;style>
    .main-doc-section {
        font-size: 18px;
        font-family: "Comic Sans MS", "Comic Sans", cursive;
        position: static;

        color: rgb(5, 4, 10)

                        </pre>
        In the example below, the styling elements of the "section-main" id are being changed.
        <pre>
                            <code>
&lt;style>
    #section-main {

        Those are some basic examples of CSS. Feel free to practice some CSS yourself!

      <header class="main-headers">
        <h2>CSS comments</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          You probably know that in HTML, comments are written like this: &lt;!-- This is a comment --> (and if you didn't, you know it now.)
          <br>
          CSS also has a way of writing comments to make it easier for the user to navigate the .css document or to write whatever you want to.
          You may have noticed in one of the examples above that I wrote the following:
          <code>
            /* ^ That means that the background colour will be black because black contains 0 red, 0 green and 0 blue. */
          </code>
          The <code>/* */</code> characters represent a comment in CSS. After the first <code>/* </code> characters, you write whatever you would like to
          include in the comment. For this example, the comment will include the following text: "Lorem Ipsum." If you wanted to write a CSS comment that
          contains that text, the comment would look like this: <code>/* Lorem Ipsum */</code>
          <br>
          Congratulations, you now know how to write a comment in CSS!

          You now (hopefully) know the basics of CSS and how CSS works. However, you are no way near being a master in CSS. You still have lots to learn.
          If would like to learn more about CSS, which I would highly recommend if you have the time, you take the free responsive web design course on
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a>. This course teaches you a lot about web development and you will learn a lot about
          HTML and CSS by taking it. Once you have done the course and you feel like a genius, you will be presented with some challenges that will
          take away that feeling because you will have forgotten most of what you learnt. However, this is ok. Coding is not about knowing all the syntax
          instantly. Coding is about learning how things work, solving problems and finding patterns. During the challenges, if you are stuck (because you
          100% will be), you can research your problem on
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools.com</a>. W3Schools has information on every single HTML tag ever created and every single CSS element
          ever created, you can rely on that when you encounter problems.
          <br>
          I hope that you enjoyed this guide and that it helped you.
